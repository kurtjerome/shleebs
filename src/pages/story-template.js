            Well, I’m guessing I should start of with a wee bit of background
            information, right? I know it’s kind of hard to keep track of me at
            times, so I’ll let you in on what’s going on. So I landed a job with
            an international education company in Cambridge, MA—EF Cultural Care
            Au Pair—so after a short and sweet thought process, I decided to
            uproot my life and move to Bahstahn (Boston). I’ve now been here for
            just over a week and it’s been great so far. But nothing compares to
            that first day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your first day, wherever it may be, is always pinpointed as one of
            the most crucial times when going anywhere. So many first
            impressions, so many emotions, so much unknown. First day feels, am
            I right?!
          </p>
          <p>
            To start off, moving in was really quite quick. Super
            easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy—it took about five minutes after I picked
            up my new fancy shmancy keys. Dad and Rylee saw me off. Of course Ry
            couldn’t leave without shedding a tear, or 50; normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            I unpacked everything. Took a while just because I was a little bit
            anal about putting things in the right place to maximize the
            efficiency of the temporary small space I have been generously given
            by a co-worker. That, and I just kept pacing around the room
            thinking, “Wow I actually live here now…well at least for the time
            being until I move into my next small space.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Trixibelle (not my co-workers real name, but for privacy reasons
            that’s what it is now) arrived home and I was stoked to start
            talking with her and familiarizing myself with people as quick as
            possible. We chatted for a bit and then she told me that she was
            going out with some friends for a movie. No problem. Don’t stop your
            life on my account—it gives me a chance to break out of my
            shelb-shell and explore the surrounding area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than Scotland, I’ve never really explored the area on my day
            of arrival. As much as I just wanted to stay in—exhausted from the
            drive, unpacking, and the addition of hot as hell humid weather—I
            thought why not, right?
          </p>
          <p>We’re going for a walk!</p>
          <p>
            What a great idea. Not only did I get to see the glistening city
            skyline from afar, but I got my steps in for the day, gained that
            small ounce of confidence needed to get my feet off the ground, AND
            even walked home without using Google maps. Can I get a WOOT WOOT?
            *cue the woot woot*
          </p>
          <p>
            I got home, sweat on my brow and on my jean hat, and so ready to
            take a cold shower. Need to hydrate first though. With a tin Moscow
            Mule cup full of ice cold water in one hand and my pocket journal
            and pen in the other, I made my way to the outside porch to rest and
            relax before I totally dowsed myself in a night full of “zen”. With
            Conrad playing by Ben Howard I stepped outside and closed the door.
          </p>
          <p>Wait. Stop. Did I just? Yes.</p>
          <p>7:30 p.m. LOCKED OUT.</p>
          <p>
            Locked out of the house I just moved into, in the city I just became
            a resident of about two hours prior. How could I be such a dip
            shit—such a mass hole?!
          </p>
          <p>
            After the initial shock of my “dumb assery” (if that’s even a word),
            45 minutes was spent trying to pick the lock and/or trying to figure
            out if the screen window on the side of the house would slide up. I
            quickly figured out my robbery/theif skills are at a all time high
            of zero and I didn’t feel like getting the cops called on me and
            going to jail if the neighbors saw me crawling in a _____x______
            window. ABORT MISSION.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trixibelle’s movie started at 9:45, and it was currently only 7:30.
            With no purse, no money, no spare key, and absolutely no dignity, I
            decided to make the night all my own and take on the town.
          </p>
          <p>
            I headed to Medford where I landed at a bar called __________.
            Walking in I could tell I was surrounded by all the “regulars” that
            probably came in every night for a pint or five. Then there was me,
            Shelby Sage Lisieski, a newbie from Upstate New York sipping lemon
            water…on the rocks. Sitting at the dark wooden bar I looked around
            at all the dim old light fixtures and people screaming back into the
            kitchen where the aroma of pizza leaked from. I was in awe of all
            the thick Boston accents. I literally had someone behind me yell,
            “FUHGET UHBOUT ET!”. Also, tons of old men at the bar kept asking
            what I was writing about when they saw me frantically scrambling in
            my journal that was filled with notes and a crappy drawing of the
            glass cup in front of me.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I first arrived at the bar, I took a seat and embraced the
            surroundings that I would be embracing for the next few hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s hawt out there isn’t it?”, a woman in a white blouse with
            curly Q hair said to me as I wiped sweat from my upper lip and neck.
            I agreed and then conversation just flowed after that. Annette was
            her name; she was a Medford local. Her and her
            husband/boyfriend/man-friend sat and talked to me for quite some
            time. They spoke of the nice places in Boston, high rent, and their
            grandbabies that were headed to the Cape this next weekend. They
            were sweet and offered to get me food or wine, but in insisted I was
            fine with my lemon water and their company.
          </p>
          <p>
            After they left I was alone in my thoughts, kind of hungry, and oh
            so tired. A man came up to me and asked if I was writing about
            him—not this again—then continued to ask me questions about the
            “book” I was writing, then followed up by stating he wishes he could
            write a book, however, he didn’t know how to spell. Sad excuse if
            you ask me!
          </p>
          <p>
            At that point it was 10:30 on a Saturday night, and realized that
            the freaks come out at night so it was about time to make my way
            home.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I exited the bar saying so long to the few people I became
            acquainted with, I was quickly reminded of the porch that was
            waiting for me, and the locked door waiting for my return. With each
            step I took I couldn’t help but just laugh at myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arriving home I took my refuge on the hard wood that would be my bed
            for the next few hours. As I laid down and looked up into the sky I
            saw something very unfamiliar. I did not see bright shining stars
            like I was used to in wide open Western New York, but instead I saw
            clouds filled with the light coming from the city. I do miss the
            night sky where I could see the constellations connecting with one
            another, but I couldn’t help but love this new and uncanny sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a laid there on the porch talking to my phone doing speech to
            text to jot down my thoughts, I realized how beautiful and perfect
            the night way. I was so proud and happy to have finally made it. To
            be here in this new city taking on this new adventure that was all
            mine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just me alone, perfectly warm weather with an amazing breeze, and
            most importantly no rain; first time that’s happened in a while. Who
            would’ve thunk! With the cheery drunk sounds of a party and laughter
            happening next-door and a few motorcycle revs in the distance, I
            smiled. I knew where the city was, and I was in the very midst of
            it. And with the wooden porch underneath me, it brought me comfort—
            I knew getting used to sleeping on the floor would pay off!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Laying like this reminds me of sleeping I’m calling among island in
            the Philippines the breeze was just right and I slept like a baby in
            that hammock. Though I’m not on the beach, this would paneling
            underneath me is just as comfy.” because I know no matter how hard
            life can be it’s always here to support me. and about to fall sleep
            in five seconds. Stay discovering XOXO from Edward Street
